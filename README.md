# rock-paper-and-scissors
Yes, the old game.

The code is adjusted to compensate for typing errors. The game understands the upper and lower case letters (rock=ROCK=rOcK=...), one missing letter (paper=papr=aper=...), and one miss-typed letter (scissors=scissots=ccissors=...). The game accepts also the first letters: r = rock, p = paper, s = scissors.

The game is a "best of five" type: a game ends if either CPU or the player gets 3 wins. After a game, the code asks if the player wants to continue or quit.
